# Coding Challenge 5

In this assignment, we create a program to manage employee salaries and calculate manager's annual salary including 15% bonus. Similar to the coding challenge 4, we enhance the understanding of inheritance in object-oriented programming by extending the `Employee` class to create the `Manager` class with additional properties and methods.

You can find the assignment in the `cc_j5.js` file.
